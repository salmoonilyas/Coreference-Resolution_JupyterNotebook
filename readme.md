# Co-Reference Resolution

In this project following two libraries are explored for coreference:

- Coreference using "neuralcoref"
- Coreference using "Corefree"

As part of my course work these libraries were presented and explained to the master students of university along with the theory of coreference.

[NeuralCoref 4.0:](https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref) Coreference Resolution in spaCy with Neural Networks.

[Coreferee:](https://spacy.io/universe/project/coreferee) Coreference resolution for multiple languages. Coreferee is a pipeline plugin that performs coreference resolution for English, French, German and Polish.

SpaCy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython.
